# gentoo-ebuilds

This is a mirror of my local Gentoo ebuild repository, meant to host ebuilds for every somewhat niche piece of software I wish to install through Portage, but still lacks an official package.

### Package List:
- **app-editors/trilium** ([homepage](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium))
    - Hierarchical note taking app for personal knowledge bases.
